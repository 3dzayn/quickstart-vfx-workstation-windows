## Visual Effects (VFX) Workstations on the AWS Cloud


This Quick Start automatically creates a highly available environment for VFX workstations on the AWS Cloud, using AWS services and Teradici software, into a configuration of your choice.

The deployment uses G3 GPU instances, which are designed for graphics-intensive workloads. Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) provides highly durable, secure, and scalable storage for VFX content. Teradici's PC-over-IP (PCoIP) technology, Teradici Cloud Access Software, and AWS Direct Connect enable a powerful remote desktop experience with low-latency network connections back to your studio.

The Quick Start offers two deployment options:

- Deploying the VFX environment into a new virtual private cloud (VPC) on AWS
- Deploying the VFX environment into an existing VPC on AWS

Each deployment takes about 30 minutes. You can also use the AWS CloudFormation templates as a starting point for your own implementation.
